# Cloudinary Image Function

Lambda for generating a predetermined Cloudinary image transform by ID. Particularly useful for being able to control an image dynamically with a static link.

## âš¡ Quick Start

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/colbyfayock/cloudinary-image-function)

* Deploy to Netlify (use button above)
* Add your Cloudinary cloud name as CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME under Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment
* Once deployed, you're ready to get started!

Your function should now be available at:

```
https://[your-netlify-site].netlify.com/.netlify/functions/image
```

Though it won't do much without configuration.

## Setup

To begin setup, with a newly cloned repo:
```
yarn install
```

To test this locally, run:
```
yarn serve
```
Which will start the function available at `localhost:9000/tweet`

### Config


### Env
Create a local `.env` file with the shared secret. This is used to store your cloud name within the deployment.

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="[cloud name]"
```

Wherever this is getting deployed, you'll need to set up an environment variable with that name that will populate the `process.env` when the function is ran. With Netlify, you can set this up as a Build Environment Variable.
